# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines security measures, best practices, and recent security improvements for the LOS App.

## Recent Security Fixes

### 1. API Key Security (Critical - Fixed)
**Issue**: API keys were hardcoded in client-side configuration files.
**Risk**: High - API keys exposed to all users
**Fix**: 
- Moved API keys to environment variables
- Updated `config/football-webpages-config.js` to use `process.env.RAPIDAPI_KEY`
- Updated Netlify functions to use environment variables
- Created `config/env.example` for proper configuration

**Action Required**: 
1. Set `VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY` environment variable in Netlify dashboard
2. Never commit actual API keys to version control

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
**Location**: Netlify Dashboard > Site Settings > Environment Variables
**Required Variables**:
- `VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY`: Your RapidAPI key for football data

## Security Best Practices

### 1. API Key Management
- ✅ Never hardcode API keys in source code
- ✅ Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- ✅ Rotate API keys regularly
- ✅ Use different keys for development and production

### 2. Input Validation
- ✅ Validate all user inputs
- ✅ Sanitize data before processing
- ✅ Use parameterized queries (when applicable)
- ✅ Implement rate limiting on API endpoints

### 3. Error Handling
- ✅ Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- ✅ Log errors securely
- ✅ Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- ✅ Handle edge cases gracefully

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Use Firebase Authentication for user management
- ✅ Implement proper role-based access control
- ✅ Validate user permissions on all admin functions
- ✅ Use secure session management

### 5. Data Protection
- ✅ Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- ✅ Use HTTPS for all communications
- ✅ Implement proper CORS policies
- ✅ Validate data integrity

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All API keys moved to environment variables
- [ ] No sensitive data in source code
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling secure
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] API keys rotated quarterly
- [ ] Dependencies updated regularly
- [ ] Security audits performed
- [ ] Access logs monitored
- [ ] Backup procedures tested

## Incident Response

### If API Key is Compromised
1. Immediately rotate the API key
2. Update environment variables
3. Check access logs for unauthorized usage
4. Monitor for suspicious activity
5. Update documentation

### If Security Breach is Suspected
1. Assess the scope of the breach
2. Secure affected systems
3. Notify relevant parties
4. Document the incident
5. Implement additional security measures
