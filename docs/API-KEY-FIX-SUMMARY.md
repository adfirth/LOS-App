# API Key and Environment Variables Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

The application was experiencing several issues related to API key access and environment variable handling:

1. **Registration tab contains no data** - Firebase data not loading properly
2. **Test API connection doesn't work** - API key not accessible in browser
3. **Football Web Pages API Integration inactive** - Same API key issue
4. **Player Picks tab has no data** - Firebase data access issues
5. **As It Stands tab empty** - Firebase data access issues

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue was that environment variables (specifically `VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY`) were not being properly exposed to the browser context. Here's why:

1. **Environment Variables in Browser**: The `VITE_` prefix is for Vite.js, but this project uses Webpack
2. **No Build Process**: The app runs directly in the browser without a build process that injects environment variables
3. **Server vs Client**: Environment variables are only available server-side (Netlify functions), not client-side (browser)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. New Environment Configuration System

Created `config/env-config.js` that:
- Handles environment variables for both client-side and server-side usage
- Provides multiple fallback mechanisms
- Exposes configuration through `window.ENV_CONFIG`

### 2. Updated Configuration Files

**Updated `config/football-webpages-config.js`:**
- Enhanced environment variable detection
- Better fallback mechanisms
- Improved error handling and logging

**Updated `src/modules/api/footballWebPages.js`:**
- Added support for `ENV_CONFIG` access
- Enhanced configuration loading with retry mechanisms
- Better error reporting

### 3. Netlify Build Script

Created `netlify/build-script.js` that:
- Injects environment variables into client-side code during build
- Updates `netlify.toml` to run the build script
- Ensures environment variables are available in the browser

### 4. Updated HTML Files

Added `config/env-config.js` to all HTML files:
- `index.html`
- `pages/admin.html`
- `pages/dashboard.html`
- `pages/register.html`
- `pages/login.html`
- `pages/table.html`
- `pages/rules.html`

### 5. Test Page

Created `test-env.html` to:
- Verify environment variables are loading correctly
- Test API connections
- Debug configuration issues

## How to Deploy the Fix

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Netlify

In your Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Environment variables and set:

```
VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_actual_rapidapi_key_here
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

The build process will now:
1. Run the build script to inject environment variables
2. Build the application with proper configuration
3. Deploy with environment variables available in the browser

### 3. Test the Fix

1. Visit `test-env.html` to verify environment variables are working
2. Check the admin panel's "Test API Connection" button
3. Verify that registration data loads from Firebase
4. Test the Football Web Pages API integration

## Configuration Hierarchy

The system now checks for API keys in this order:

1. `window.ENV_CONFIG.RAPIDAPI_KEY` (injected by build script)
2. `window.FOOTBALL_WEBPAGES_CONFIG.RAPIDAPI_KEY` (from config file)
3. `window.RAPIDAPI_KEY` (global fallback)
4. Development API key (hardcoded fallback)

## Firebase Configuration

Firebase configuration remains unchanged and should work correctly:
- Configuration is hardcoded in `config/firebase-init.js`
- This is appropriate for client-side Firebase usage
- No environment variables needed for Firebase client-side

## Troubleshooting

### If API keys still don't work:

1. **Check Netlify Environment Variables**: Ensure `VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY` is set in Netlify dashboard
2. **Check Build Logs**: Look for build script execution in Netlify deploy logs
3. **Use Test Page**: Visit `test-env.html` to debug configuration
4. **Check Browser Console**: Look for configuration loading messages

### If Firebase data doesn't load:

1. **Check Firebase Rules**: Ensure Firestore security rules allow read access
2. **Check Authentication**: Verify user authentication is working
3. **Check Network Tab**: Look for Firebase API calls in browser dev tools

## Files Modified

- `config/env-config.js` (new)
- `config/football-webpages-config.js` (updated)
- `src/modules/api/footballWebPages.js` (updated)
- `netlify/build-script.js` (new)
- `netlify.toml` (updated)
- All HTML files (updated to include env-config.js)
- `test-env.html` (new)

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes to Netlify
2. Set the `VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY` environment variable in Netlify dashboard
3. Test all functionality:
   - Registration data loading
   - API connections
   - Player picks data
   - As It Stands data
4. Monitor for any remaining issues

This fix should resolve all the API key and environment variable issues while maintaining backward compatibility and providing robust fallback mechanisms.
