# Tester System Implementation

## Overview

The tester system allows administrators to promote registered users to testers, giving them access to live scores and vidiprinter features for trial game weeks. Testers are automatically assigned to a special "Tester Edition" while regular users use "Edition 1". Regular users will see "coming soon" messages for these features.

## Features

### For Testers:
- âœ… Can register normally through standard registration
- âœ… **Automatically assigned to "Tester Edition"** (separate from main competition)
- âœ… Full access to scores tab with live updates
- âœ… Full access to vidiprinter with live match updates
- âœ… Can make picks for trial game weeks (1 & 2)
- âœ… All normal dashboard functionality
- âœ… **Visual indicator** showing they're in tester edition (ðŸ§ª icon)

### For Regular Users:
- âœ… Can register normally when registration window is open
- âœ… **Assigned to "Edition 1"** (main competition)
- ðŸ”’ Scores tab shows "Coming Soon" message
- ðŸ”’ Vidiprinter tab shows "Coming Soon" message
- âœ… Can make picks when registration is open

### For Administrators:
- âœ… Can promote any registered user to tester status
- âœ… Can remove tester status from users
- âœ… Admin panel shows tester status for all users
- âœ… Easy toggle buttons in user management
- âœ… **Separate edition management** for testers vs regular users

## Configuration

### Managing Tester Access

The system now uses admin promotion instead of email-based access:

1. **Users register normally** through the standard registration process
2. **Admin promotes users** to tester status via the admin panel
3. **Testers get immediate access** to scores and vidiprinter features
4. **Testers are automatically assigned** to "Tester Edition"

### Edition System

The system automatically manages editions:

- **Testers**: Automatically use "Tester Edition" (edition: 'tester')
- **Regular Users**: Use "Edition 1" (edition: 1)
- **Visual Indicators**: Testers see ðŸ§ª icon and green text for their edition
- **Tooltips**: Hover over edition displays to see edition information

### Admin Panel Management

In the admin panel under "Registration Management":

1. **View all registered users** in the registration list
2. **Click "Make Tester"** to promote a user to tester status
3. **Click "Remove Tester"** to remove tester status
4. **Tester status is clearly displayed** for each user
5. **Edition information** is shown for each user

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`app.js`** - Updated to use admin-promoted tester system with dynamic editions
2. **`tester-config.js`** - Enhanced configuration for tester edition management
3. **`style.css`** - Added styles for "coming soon" messages, disabled tabs, and tester edition indicators
4. **`dashboard.html`** - Added tester-config.js script reference
5. **`register.html`** - Added tester-config.js script reference
6. **`index.html`** - Added tester-config.js script reference

### Key Functions

#### Registration Logic
- `checkRegistrationWindow(userId)` - Standard registration window check with user-specific edition support
- `isUserTester(userId)` - Checks if user is promoted to tester
- `getUserEdition(userId)` - Returns the appropriate edition for a user

#### Access Control
- `handleTesterAccessRestrictions(userData, userId)` - Applies restrictions based on user type
- Shows "coming soon" messages for non-testers
- Disables scores and vidiprinter tabs for non-testers

#### Edition Management
- `getUserEdition(userId)` - Dynamically determines user's edition
- Automatic edition assignment based on tester status
- Visual indicators for tester edition

#### Admin Management
- `toggleTesterStatus(userId, currentStatus)` - Promotes/removes tester status
- Admin panel integration for easy management

### Database Changes

Users now have an `isTester` field in their profile:
```javascript
{
    // ... other user fields
    isTester: true/false  // Set via admin panel
}
```

The system automatically determines the edition based on this field.

## Usage Instructions

   - Click "Make Tester" button
   - User immediately gets tester access and is assigned to Tester Edition

   - Testers can still access their features

3. **Monitor tester activity:**
   - Check the admin panel for tester registrations
   - Review tester picks and feedback
   - Remove tester status if needed

4. **Edition management:**
   - Testers automatically use "Tester Edition"

   - No manual edition assignment needed

### For Testers

1. **Register:**
   - Go to `/register.html`
   - Register normally with any email

2. **Dashboard access:**
   - See "Edition 1" (main competition)
   - Scores tab shows "Coming Soon" message
   - Vidiprinter tab shows "Coming Soon" message
   - Other features work normally when registration is open

## Testing the System

### Test Admin Promotion
1. Register a test user normally
2. Login as admin and go to Registration Management
3. Click "Make Tester" for the test user
4. Login as test user and verify:
   - Access to scores/vidiprinter
   - "Tester Edition" display with ðŸ§ª icon
   - Hover tooltip shows edition information

### Test Regular User Restrictions
1. Register with a regular user account
2. Verify "coming soon" messages on scores/vidiprinter
3. Verify "Edition 1" display (no special styling)
4. Promote to tester and verify:
   - Access is granted
   - Edition changes to "Tester Edition"
   - Visual indicators appear

### Test Admin Panel
1. Login as admin
2. Check that tester status is displayed correctly
3. Test promoting and removing tester status
4. Verify edition information is shown

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tester can't access features:**
   - Check if user has `isTester: true` in database
   - Verify admin promotion was successful
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **"Coming soon" messages not showing:**
   - Check that `handleTesterAccessRestrictions()` is called
   - Verify CSS styles are loaded
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

3. **Admin toggle not working:**
   - Verify admin permissions
   - Check database connection
   - Look for error messages in console

4. **Edition not displaying correctly:**
   - Check that `getUserEdition()` function is working
   - Verify tester status in database
   - Check CSS for tester edition styles

### Debug Mode

Add this to the browser console to debug:
```javascript
// Check if current user is a tester
console.log('Current user:', auth.currentUser);
console.log('User data:', await db.collection('users').doc(auth.currentUser.uid).get().then(doc => doc.data()));

// Check user edition
const userEdition = await getUserEdition(auth.currentUser.uid);
console.log('User edition:', userEdition);

// Check tester config
console.log('Tester config:', TESTER_CONFIG);
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin-only promotion:** Only admins can promote users to testers
2. **Database validation:** Tester status is stored securely in database
3. **Access logging:** Monitor tester access for security
4. **Admin permissions:** Ensure only authorized admins can promote users
5. **Edition isolation:** Testers use separate edition to prevent interference

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk operations:** Promote multiple users at once
2. **Time-limited access:** Add expiration dates for tester access
3. **Feature flags:** More granular control over which features testers can access
4. **Analytics:** Track tester usage and feedback
5. **Invitation system:** Send email invitations to testers
6. **Edition customization:** Allow custom edition names and settings
7. **Cross-edition features:** Allow testers to view main edition data

2. Review the browser console for error messages
3. Verify admin permissions and database access
4. Test with different user accounts to isolate issues
5. Check edition assignment and visual indicators
